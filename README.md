Implementation of model predictive control with learned neural network system dynamics model.
The code aims to reproduce the results of the paper [Deep Reinforcement Learning in a Handful of Trials using Probabilistic Dynamics Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12114).

This was part of the TU Darmstadt class Application of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms taught by Jan Peters.
